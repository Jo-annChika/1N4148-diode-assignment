# Electrical Characteristics of the 1N4148 Diode

This information is based on the Vishay 1N4148 datasheet and explained in my own words.

## Forward Voltage
The forward voltage of the 1N4148 diode is around 0.62 V to 0.72 V when a forward current of 10 mA flows through it.  
This means the diode loses only a small amount of voltage when conducting, which is good for signal circuits.

## Maximum Reverse Voltage
The maximum reverse voltage of the diode is 100 V.  
This is the highest reverse voltage the diode can handle safely without breaking down.

## Maximum Forward Current
The maximum continuous forward current of the 1N4148 diode is 200 mA.  
If the current goes above this value for a long time, the diode could overheat and be damaged.

## Operating Temperature Range
The diode can operate between −65 °C and +175 °C.  
This wide temperature range allows it to work reliably in many environments.

## Real Application
One real application of the 1N4148 diode is in fast switching circuits, such as digital logic circuits and signal clamping circuits.  
Its fast response makes it suitable for handling rapidly changing signals.
